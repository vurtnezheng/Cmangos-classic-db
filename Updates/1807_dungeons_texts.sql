-- Ragefire Chasm
UPDATE npc_text SET text0_0="Ragefire Chasm consists of a network of volcanic caverns that lie below the orcs' new capital city of Orgrimmar. Recently, rumors have spread that a cult loyal to the demonic Shadow Council has taken up residence within the Chasm's fiery depths. This cult, known as the Burning Blade, threatens the very sovereignty of Durotar. Many believe that the orc Warchief, Thrall, is aware of the Blade's existence and has chosen not to destroy it in the hopes that its members might lead him straight to the Shadow Council. Either way, the dark powers emanating from Ragefire Chasm could undo all that the orcs have fought to attain.", text0_1="Ragefire Chasm consists of a network of volcanic caverns that lie below the orcs' new capital city of Orgrimmar.

-- Wailing Caverns
UPDATE npc_text SET text0_0="Recently, a night elf druid named Naralex discovered a network of underground caverns within the heart of the Barrens. Dubbed the ‘Wailing Caverns’, these natural caves were filled with steam fissures which produced long, mournful wails as they vented. Naralex believed he could use the caverns’ underground springs to restore lushness and fertility to the Barrens – but to do so would require siphoning the energies of the fabled Emerald Dream. Once connected to the Dream however, the druid’s vision somehow became a nightmare. Soon the Wailing Caverns began to change – the waters turned foul and the once-docile creatures inside metamorphosed into vicious, deadly predators. It is said that Naralex himself still resides somewhere inside the heart of the labyrinth, trapped beyond the edges of the Emerald Dream. Even his former acolytes have been corrupted by their master’s waking nightmare – transformed into the wicked Druids of the Fang.", text0_1="Recently, a night elf druid named Naralex discovered a network of underground caverns within the heart of the Barrens.

-- Shadowfang Keep
UPDATE npc_text SET text0_0="During the Third War, the wizards of the Kirin Tor battled against the undead armies of the Scourge. When the wizards of Dalaran died in battle, they would rise soon after - adding their former might to the growing Scourge. Frustrated by their lack of progress (and against the advice of his peers) the Archmage, Arugal elected to summon extra-dimensional entities to bolster Dalaran's diminishing ranks. Arugal's summoning brought the ravenous worgen into the world of Azeroth. The feral wolf-men slaughtered not only the Scourge, but quickly turned on the wizards themselves. The worgen sieged the keep of the noble, Baron Silverlaine. Situated above the tiny hamlet of Pyrewood, the keep quickly fell into shadow and ruin. Driven mad with guilt, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to the newly dubbed 'Shadowfang Keep'. It's said he still resides there, protected by his massive pet, Fenrus - and haunted by the vengeful ghost of Baron Silverlaine.", text0_1="During the Third War, the wizards of the Kirin Tor battled against the undead armies of the Scourge.
